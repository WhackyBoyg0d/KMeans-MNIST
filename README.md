## KMeans-MNIST
# Task: clustering MNIST handwritten digits with K-means
The projects involves defining a K-means model, fit it to handwritten digit images and evaluate the performance. The K-means algorithm is implemented with PyTorch and gradient descent. The dataset employed here is the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, which consists of handwritten digits of resolution 28 * 28 and their corresponding labels.
